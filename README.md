# Weather Tech App

## Overview
The **Weather Tech App** is a simple Python-based desktop application that allows users to get real-time weather information for any Indian state. It uses the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch current weather conditions, including climate, description, temperature, and pressure.

## Features
- Select any Indian state from a dropdown menu.
- Retrieve and display the current weather, including:
  - Main climate condition
  - Weather description
  - Temperature (in Celsius)
  - Atmospheric pressure

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Tkinter (for the GUI)
- Requests library

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/weather-tech-app.git
   cd weather-tech-app
   ```

2. **Install the required Python packages**:
   ```bash
   pip install requests
   ```

## Usage

   ```

2. Select your state from the dropdown menu and click "DONE" to fetch the weather details.

## Code Explanation

- **Tkinter** is used for building the GUI.
- **Requests** library is used to fetch weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API.
- The weather data is displayed in the form of labels on the application window.

## API Key
Ensure you have a valid OpenWeatherMap API key. Replace the placeholder in the `data_get` function with your own API key.

```python
data = requests.get("https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q="+city+"&appid=YOUR_API_KEY").json()
```
